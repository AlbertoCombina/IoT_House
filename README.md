# IoT_House

The goal of this project is to create a web server using the Arduino Uno R4 Wifi, in order to:
- Detect temperature and humidity in the house
- Display the infos in a local display
- Display all the data in the Arduino IoT app
- Add several slave nodes to detect the humidity of the soil in the plants around the house
- Drive lights in the house from the master node
- Drive lights in the house from the Arduino App
- Interact with Alexa
